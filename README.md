# TO DO LIST

Overall: pay attention to const and &

<br>Note: class Playlist: string name; list<string> song_names;
<br>      1. changes of song's data that are yet not visible in file are being found in the tree of all songs
<br>      2. data doesn't need to be changed at more than one structure in file (all changes only in tree)
<br>      3. easier to read from/to file (class User)
<br>
<br>1. AVLTree
<br>  1.1 check all playlist funcs for corner cases!
<br>  1.2 "White Spaces" in funcs with strings
<br>  
<br>2. Commands
<br>  2.1 validation
<br>  
<br>3. User
<br>  3.1 consider validaiton inside setters
<br>  
<br>4. Song
<br>  4.1 consider validation methods
<br>  4.2 public or private setters and getters?
<br>  4.3 const std::string& in the operator overloading?
<br>
<br>5. Parser
<br>  5.1 create custom queue class
