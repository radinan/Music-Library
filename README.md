# TO DO LIST

<br>Note: class Playlist: string name; list<string> song_names;
<br>      1. changes of song's data that are yet not visible in file are being found in the tree of all songs
<br>      2. data doesn't need to be changed at more than one structure in file (all changes only in tree)
<br>      3. easier to read from/to file (class User)
